               Nepali cuisine is renowned for its rich and aromatic use of spices, 
               which create the unique flavors found in every dish. Common spices include cumin, 
               coriander, turmeric, fenugreek, and mustard seeds, each adding depth and warmth to curries
               and stews. Ginger and garlic are essential for their pungent and savory notes, while dried
               red chilies and Sichuan pepper (timur) bring a signature heat and tingling sensation. 
               Cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves are often used in festive rice dishes and desserts, 
               infusing them with sweet and fragrant undertones. Bay leaves and ajwain (carom seeds) 
               are added to lentil soups and pickles for extra aroma. Jimbu, a Himalayan herb, 
               is unique to Nepali cooking and is especially popular in mountain regions. Together, 
               these spices not only enhance taste but also reflect the diverse geography and cultural 
               heritage of Nepal, making every meal a vibrant and memorable experience.
